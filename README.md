I used a carousell as opposed to a pageview just to simplify rotating back to the first entry in the page in a real production environment where there are more than 10 posts to display a pageview is recommended I just used a carousell to optimize memory usage since duplicates were deleted there is an older version of this code where I use a pageview but it would just request new posts everytime without any optimization


just clone and run
